            <p>For my senior year capstone, I had the opportunity to work alongside Annuska Zolyomi to design an application called Converswim, 
                a conversation reflection tool meant to be used by autistic adults. The motivation to develop this app came from prior research 
                conducted by Zolyomi which explored the challenges that autistic adults face in reading emotion, body language, and other non-verbal social cues
                when it comes to conversating with neurotypical individuals.
            </p>
            <img src="images/swimlane.JPG" alt="">
            <p>Most of my capstone work was done in the design phase, in which I was able to conduct several usability studies
                with a paper-prototype that demonstrates initial screen designs and intended interactions of the application.
                During our research, our goal was to acquire data on the usability of the application, feature usage, and overall
                first impressions. My research team consisting of Professor Zolyomi, Hiba Hasan, a Psychology student at UW
                Bothell, and I received insightful feedback on how to continually optimize the app to assure that the application
                suits our target usersâ€™ needs.
                </p>
            <p>The next steps of this project would be to start implementing the prototype into a
                functional web application. This would entail choosing an appropriate framework to develop the user interface
                and database to support image customization requests. My recommendation is React (with Javascript, HTML,
                and CSS) to develop the UI. To support image requests, I would utilize a combination of an object storage
                system such as Amazon S3 with a NoSQL database such as MongoDB to handle image history queries. These
                next steps yield a great project for capstone students to take on in the future.  
            </p>
