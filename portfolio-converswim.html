            <h3>The Project</h3>
            <p>For my senior year capstone, I had the opportunity to work alongside Annuska Zolyomi to design an application called Converswim, 
                a conversation reflection tool meant to be used by autistic adults. The motivation to develop this app came from prior research 
                conducted by Zolyomi which explored the challenges that autistic adults face in reading emotion, body language, and other non-verbal social cues
                when it comes to conversating with neurotypical individuals.
            </p>
            <img src="images/swimlane.JPG" alt="" class="thumbnail">
            <h3>What I did</h3>
            <p>Most of my capstone work was done in the design phase, in which I was able to conduct several usability studies with a paper-prototype that demonstrates 
                initial screen designs and intended interactions of the application. Through an online flyer, I recruited paired participants in which one or both parties 
                identified as having some functioning form of autism. During my research, the goal was to acquire data on the usability of the application, feature usage, 
                and overall first impressions. 
            </p>
            <h3>What I learned + Findings</h3>
            <p>
                My research team, consisting of Professor Zolyomi, Hiba Hasan, a Psychology student at UW Bothell, and I received insightful feedback on how to continually 
                optimize the app to ensure that the application suits our target users’ needs. The following are the quantitative and qualitative results we found on key feature usage: 

                    <li>75% of participants utilized “Create” feature</li>
                    <li>75% of participants utilized “Text” feature</li>
                    <li>50% of participants utilized “More Icons” button</li>
                    <li>Desired feature to add more “levels” to conversation board</li>
                    <li>Overall desire for a tutorial walkthrough for first time users</li>
            </p>
            <p>If Converswim were an actual company, I believe that my research would provide groundbreaking insight into how the usability, feasibility, and viability of the product can 
                be improved especially in the early stages of its design. This project helped me gain insight into the technicalities of leading an entire usability study on my own, and 
                just how important it is to keep key user personas in mind when designing interfaces. Please feel free to check out
                the prototype <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/HhgF9G1Jmvd26UmbAlidoX/Converswim-(Community)?type=design&mode=design&t=QWLcZj6ah08MToWP-1">here!</a>
