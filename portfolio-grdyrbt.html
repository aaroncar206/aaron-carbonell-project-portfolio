            <p>For a Usability & User-Centered Design course I took in Winter 2022, I collaborated with a research team of 3 to explore how usable our existing restaurant
                management systems (RMS) are for food workers in terms of collaboration with others, and to implement what users thought were lacking into a newly improved RMS prototype.</p>
            <img src="images/rms.JPG" alt="">
            <p>To kickstart the formative research phase, we put out an online survey meant to be taken by food workers anonymously and asks the following overarching research questions: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Which position in the restaurant is using the system often?</p></li>
                <li><p>Which restaurant management system do people use the most?</p></li>
                <li><p>What are the barriers for the people working in the kitchen to use the management
                    system?</p></li>
                <li><p>What are the features of the system that we can improve and improve the user's
                    experience?</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Based off the results found in our formative research, the evaluative research phase consisted of designing a newly improved RMS prototype based on feedback given (as depicted
                above), recruiting participants to conduct usability studies with, and conducting our studies with participants to gain further insight on the usability of the RMS.
            </p>
            <p>The feedback from participants was generally very positive and indicated that they had found our RMS useful in the collaboration between different roles in the restaurants/bars.
            This project was one of my first hands-on projects as a UX Researcher and taught me so much about how much thought and detail goes into putting a study together.
